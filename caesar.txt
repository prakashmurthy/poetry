O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
Thou art the ruin of the noblest man 
Who ever livèd in the tide of times
Woe to the hands that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue—
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men.

Oh, pardon me, you bleeding corpse, for speaking 
politely and acting mildly with these butchers! 
You are what’s left of the noblest man that ever lived. 
Pity the hand that shed this valuable blood. Over your 
wounds—
which, like speechless mouths, open their red lips, 
as though to beg me to speak—I predict that a curse 
will fall upon the bodies of men.
